Simple but effective diary system that i use with my wife to keep a diary

This requires basic PHP knowledge to setup for you.

Easy to use and figure out diary system
1. add your info in your diario.php and userit.php files these to match with your username/password/db:               
                $username = "yourUserName";
                $password = "YoutPasswordxxkdk2";
                $dbname = "dbOfYours";
                
2. add hashed username and hashed password to your database where userit.php is looking.

3. add them to your server so that index where you want and then to there folders: css , js and php and add to those folders those files that have matching ends (like diario.php and userit.php to php-folder)

4. enjoy!
